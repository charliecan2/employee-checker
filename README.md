## Installation
The user will need to install Node.js from the nodejs.org website. Also, if package.json is not present, it will need to be installed by typing "npm init -y" onto the terminal and inquirer needs to be installed as well by typing "npm install inquirer". MySQL will also need to be installed, both as a package within package.json by typing "npm install mysql" onto the terminal, and the actual application from the official website at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/ and https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
## Usage
Before the user begins using this application, they will need to install mySQLWorkbench. Then they will need to copy the schema from the employee_db.sql file onto their workbench. Once that's done, we can begin.

To start using this employee tracker, you will need to open the terminal and type node index.js onto the command line. Then several options will be listed that will allow you to: View All Employees, View All Departments, View All Roles, Add Employees, Add Departments, Add Roles, Update Employee Role, Delete Employee, Delete Department, Delete Roles, and finally Quit App to exit out of the application. All of the options listed above make it easy to use and navigate through this application!
